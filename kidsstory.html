<h2>Tit for tat</h2>
This is the story of two friends the fox and the crane.
Fox is very cunning and self centered as you all know.
One day it offered a meal to crane. It asked to come for the 
party on that day and requested it not to make any 
cooking pereparations at home. It can have somptuous meal in his house.
Believing that the fox will provide the food for that day 
the crane went to the fox's house. The fox has prepared 
really go soup. It smelled great. The fox is very clever. 
It wanted to eat all th soup it self giving no chance for 
the crane drink. So it served the soup in a plate.
How can the crane drink the soup from a plate. It's beek 
can't reach the soup as it's level is too low. The crane 
saw the fox quckly drinking all the soup in front of it.
Seeing the crane unable to drink it took her portion also 
saying that you are not drinking, probably the soup does 
not taste good to you. I don't want to waste my preparation.
The crane felt very sorry and cheated. 

It wanted to give the fox a lesson.
So one day it invited the fox to the dinner saying that 
it will prepare tasty fish soup that night. 
So fox has arrived bringing its children also even though 
they were not invited for the party. However, the crane 
did not say any thing. It just wanted to teach a lesson to 
the fox but treat the children nicely. It server the soup in 
plates for the children. Crane, its children and the fox 
were served in beakers. All enjoyed tasty soup, except the 
fox. Its toungue could not reach the level of the soup in 
the beaker. In addition the beaker has a narrow mouth. The 
beaker is firmly fixed at the bottom. It can't be tilted.
This way the fox was taught a good lesson. It finally said 
thank you my friend. I admit my mistake. I am really thankful 
for treating my children like your children. This incident 
has transformed me. I am a changed preson now. Our friendship 
will stay forever. You and your children are always welcome 
to my home and you will be treated as my own.
Then the crane took pity on the fox and served the soup 
 in plate. The drank the soup and felt happy. From then on 
they became thick friends.
