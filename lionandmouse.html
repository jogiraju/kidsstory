<h2>Lion and mouse story</h1>
<p>
Once upon a time in the mid summer a lion was 
sleeping under a stree. Upon the grnches of the tree 
a mouse was jumping up and down and unexpedly fell down from 
the branch right on top of the head of the lion.
</p>
<p>
The lion's sleep was disturbed and found that a mouse 
is sitting on top of its head. It caught hold of it 
and about to kill it. The mouse pleaded with loin 
to spare her life and she will come to the lion's rescue 
if the lion does not do any horm to her.
</p>
<p>
The lion got amused. How can a small creature like 
a mouse help a mighty king of the jungle? However, it 
took pity on the mouse and amused by its boldness it spared 
her life giving just a warning.
</p>
<p>
After a week days passed a hunter put a bait to the lion and 
and lion was caught and was captured in a net. The lion 
was roring unamble to come out of the net inspite of 
here repeated afforts to escape. 
</p>
<p>
Hering the sound of the lion the mouse suspected that 
the lion was in danger and asking for help. From direction 
of the sound it reached the spot where the lion was 
captured. It quickly bit the net and released lion.
</p>
<p>
The lion was very happy and humbled. From then on they 
became very good fronds and allowed it to play jumping on 
top of its body. 
</p>
